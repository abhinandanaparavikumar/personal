          BCTC Steel Tree Competition - 17/09/2021 to 18/09/2021
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          Our team placed 1st amongst 7 teams in this competition. We won a total cash prize of 300 Euro. This competition was organized by the
          Board of European Students of Technology, Delft (BEST). The winning structure was proposed to be constructed on campus by
          'Reijrink Staalconstructie B.V' as part of the competition. The challenge was to 
          design a Steel Connections Tree in 2 days, including calculations of 6 of those connections using IDEA Statica. The assessment
          was based on four aspects: educational story (of each connection to represent a learning aspect), calculations, practicability
          and aesthetics.

              Prathamesh from the Industrial Design Faculty worked on the model of the tree on Revit. George and I worked on the analysis and
              calculations. Junaid naturally adopted the role of team leader and along with Syed, worked on the computational modelling of each
              connection on the IDEA Statica software.

              With the idea of having the structure built on campus for viewings for school children, we envisioned a sitting platform on the bottom
              branch for passers-by, a small garden on the second branch from the bottom and the rest to represent use cases of beams from industrial sheds,
              railway foot-over bridges and high-rise buildings, as an example for viewers.

        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          This is a course offerred at the Technology Policy and Management Faculty of TU Delft that I am taking up as an elective. It is about forming a
          business idea or taking an existing idea to form a viable startup business model with suitable team members and using well-formulated business
          concepts that we learn throughout the course. The course goals were succesffully fulfilled with a grade of 8.5. More information about the course can be found
          <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=65146">here</a>. A previous project employing a machine learning model to identify defects in
          bridges was further improved upon in this course.

        <p class="text1">
          I was involved with the U-BASE Association, particularly within the media committee during the academic year of 2021 to 2022. My role involved
          taking photographs and videos at the events, doing editing work at the office and compiling them for the website. I also regularly attended the
          informative lunch lectures, company visits and member events throughout the year.

              Here is a video I made as part of the association recap of quarter 3 of 2021-2022. I used Adobe Premier Pro for the editing of the video. The sound
              was a simple chord progression recorded on Logic Pro. Special thanks to my friend Jerry for helping me with the equipment and recording.
